                As a group, we worked with the start-up Allara, which is a company dedicated to improving, tracking, and managing their health. The founder had tasked us with finding ways to integrate data visualizations from labs into the preexisting user dashboard. They wanted us to hit on these points the most: motivational designs, providing visualization for progress and creating a design where people can learn and understand their health.

                After identifying the issues, we took to creating Lo-Fi wireframes of what we wanted the design to look like. Accounting for the information about users being overwhelmed by lab results, we created the designs below where you can see data “at-a-glance” and access an in-depth look at your data if you are interested, look at successes, or look at your to-do’s. We also decided on sectioning off the “at-a-glance” to the right of the dashboard and incorporated card views that we noticed were a trend in our hand-drawn sketching visualizations. In the end, based on our sketches, we decided on three main sections: “To-Do”, “Appointments” and “At-a-glance” for our first iteration wireframe.

              After the lo-fi, we presented low-fidelity wireframes to a group of 12 peers from the class. They gave us helpful critiques and mentioned how the design was still not friendly and the organization of the data visualizations could be better. They also mentioned that having a pop-up page of the separate data would be helpful.

              We also presented to our client, who expressed concerns about data integration into the primary dashboard. And stated that they wanted us to focus more on the lab results given by healthcare providers. In particular, there was a described need to shift data visualizations towards the less-used pages of the website, promoting user exploration throughout the page.

                Our first critique left us with much to consider, therefore, we started with creating a detailed style guide to aid us with our high-fidelity prototype. This allowed for asynchronous work across the group without compromising visual identity.

              <p class="regularText">
                One of our primary goals was to mimic the existing Allara website in terms of color, desktop layout, and typography. Our contact did not provide us with a formalized style guide, so we chose to extrapolate off of the publicly accessible pages that we could observe. We sought to emulate the clean, playful brand that Allara cultivates, allowing for invigorating designs while still being serious about the subject matter.

              After that, we took to implementing our hi-fi prototype on Figma. Using both desktop and mobile screen views, we decided that the primary goal of our design was decision-making. The underlying pain point of medical data is that it is often thrust upon someone, often making them feel powerless and out of control concerning their health. As such, we wanted to introduce artificial choices to allow users to feel some control while they went through their data, anticipating likely questions and next steps as they examined their information. Beyond this, we also thought to include buttons for settings and backtracking within the flow. Allowing users to feel empowered as they always had the option to adjust, ignore, or recall the data provided.

              In terms of layout, we sought to utilize white space and muted tones, allowing the user to never feel rushed or that they were ever bombarded with more than one piece of content and one choice at a time. In essence, while we wanted decision-making to be centered, we also sought to avoid introducing decision paralysis. Beyond this, the broad white space also allows for a natural separation of elements, allowing for branches to naturally develop on the page and for larger graphs and choices to take up a bulk of the page without feeling cramped. The tree structure also invokes a familiar metaphor for users of all backgrounds, as the primary content stays along the central “trunk” of the tree with options or superfluous elements that may branch out towards their respective leaves. Furthermore, choices in this guided view allow a small amount of gamification, as users may be inclined to discover and play around with different options and choices and “collect” all the possible pathways and information related to their data.

                Our Final step was to present to the founder of the start-up and receive feedback. The feedback we were given was exceptionally helpful and thoughtful, and we appreciated being able to work with Allara on this project.

              </p>
              <p class="regularText">
                We received independent feedback for both our mobile and desktop designs. For the desktop, there was an appreciation for the storytelling aspects and prioritization of agency and guidance, doing so without making a user feel lost in the flow. However, there were concerns that the proposed design would be unsatisfying for returning users to the site. Our design should have considered that an experienced user would want access to their data quickly rather than going through the guided process. And at some point, the user should be able to “see everything.”

              </p>
              <p class="regularText">
                For our mobile view, we opted for a more “story-like” flow, which was appreciated as it would be nice for new users. Again, it was noted as a potential problem for returning users.  There was also a note about potentially converting the mobile flow to be closer to the web flow, allowing the tree structure on both and vertical scrolling to navigate, emulating a more natural reading view. Between the mobile and desktop views, there was positive feedback on the styling and color choices we had selected, noting that the look of both designs felt enjoyable and fun, but remained clean throughout.

                There was much to learn from this project and I learned the importance of the iterative design process and how to be responsive to peer and client feedback. Balancing aesthetic appeal with user functionality was a challenge, however, my understanding of creating interfaces that cater to new and returning users' needs grew.
