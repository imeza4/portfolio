              As a user, sometimes you will come across a site where navigating it intuitively is not easy. As a designer, it is important to recognize which designs are efficient and how to redesign an existing product. This <b>solo student</b> projectâ€™s purpose was to practice the workflow of redesigning and coding the front page of a simple website while taking <b>responsive</b> and <b>accessibility</b> features into account.

              The Narraganset Indian Tribe website was the interface that I chose to redesign. The usability of the site is crucial for tribal members because of the services, announcements, and information it provides. The un-usability of the website was hindering people from being able to find important information such as grants, opportunities, and legal help. Thus, I wanted to <b>improve</b> the user experience so that the Narragansett Nation and those who want to learn more about the Tribe can <b>easily navigate</b> the site.

                After identifying the usability problems, I needed to begin the redesign process. Thus, I produced low-fidelity wireframes for various screen sizes so that later I would be able to build off of the original designs I created. I wanted the navigation bar to be small while keeping the Narragansett seal easy to see. Also, at the very top, I wanted to showcase the pictures that displayed the culture by having a slideshow. And give a brief blurb about the Tribe for those who know nothing about it. Then, near the bottom, but you are still able to see it, I was going to put navigation cards with pictures to make it easy to read.

                Before redesigning the original website, I built a style guide that displays the colors, typography, and interactive components of the webpage. This guide helps to ensure that the styles and interactive elements are consistent throughout the site in order for the user to have a coherent experience navigating the interface.

                After analyzing my design and solidifying the style guide, I was ready to expand on the low-fidelity wireframes.  I utilized Figma to create a high-fidelity prototype for each screen size (mobile, tablet, computer) to finalize aspects I wanted the site to have.

                This process truly helped me familiarize myself with the workflow of the design process. The style guide taught me how accessibility works and consider it when designing. It also allowed me to update my HTML and CSS skills so that I would be able to design a site that is responsive to screen size.

              <p class="regularText">
                If I were to do this project again, I would do a post-analyzation. I should have analyzed my final product before submitting it. I noticed that my alignment of items was off and the colors caused the site to not be as accessible as I thought it would be. Additionally, I would have adapted the design for short attention spans. The initial website I designed presented viewers with a large amount of information. As an aspiring designer, I have a goal of getting all people the information they need as concisely as possible.
